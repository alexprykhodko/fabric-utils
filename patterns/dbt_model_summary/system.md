Here I got a compiled dbt model using BigQuery dialect.

Can you please explain how sa_project_count field is calculated? Please use the entire DAG to reason about the output.

Provide the summary at the very end that would be readable by a person who does not understand SQL (name the section "ELI5"), but understands basics of data analysis and aggregation. Include a clear explanation of the data cleanup, if any. Explain the specifics of data deduplication, if any.

Include a simple data flow diagram using ASCII art (keep it stupid simple).
